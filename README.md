# AJT Explanatory Docs

**Status**: Non-normative / Explanatory only

This repository contains explanatory notes for understanding AJT (Audit Judgment Trail) Layer Architecture.

**Constitutional authority is NOT here.** For normative rules, see:
- [AJT Layer Architecture (Constitutional)](https://github.com/Nick-heo-eg/cognitive-infrastructure-constitution/blob/main/judgment/AJT_LAYER_ARCHITECTURE.md)

---

## Purpose

These documents help readers understand:
- Why AJT separates judgment from accountability
- Why this separation feels counterintuitive
- What changes emerge from the 5-layer structure
- How to transition from old worldview (judgment = accountability) to new worldview (judgment ≠ accountability)

**These are NOT rules.** They are explanations of rules that exist elsewhere.
